Q: How do I install Starstorm?
A: For installing RoR mods you will need the Risk of Rain ModLoader which can be downloaded from https://rainfusion.ml/.
There is also an organized steam guide to help you through this process: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2009048349.

Q: How do I unlock X character?
A: In the survivor selection menu you can hover over each character to see their requirements.
For an in-depth overview you can refer to the following user-made guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b-avFCSk3NgI_2pfVrs2LO8SWaDqAx_9xW9RbyruMJs/edit?usp=sharing.
The guide provides hints, explanations, and exact requirements on each survivor.

Q: Why does the Artifact of Command not allow me to choose certain items?
A: As of Starstorm 1.8.8, Artifact of Command was changed so that items you do not have unlocked are not selectable (similarly to Risk of Rain 2's Artifact of Command).  Note that ModLoader currently has a bug that makes locked items show and act as unlocked, this doesn't mean the item is actually unlocked, the Scores and Unlockables menu should show true information about unlocks.This is bypassed when using the "ss_unlock_all" profile flag (note that this unlocks all of Starstorm's content while active).

Q: My framerate is capped at a lower value than vanilla, what is happening?
A: Due to a ModLoader bug, the game has a lower framerate on modern monitors with higher refresh rates, the known solution is to change it from the monitor's settings to 120hz or 60hz.

Q: How can I support the mod?
